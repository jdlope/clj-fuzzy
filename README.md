# Fuzzy Inference Systems in Clojure

Basic functions for fuzzy inference systems. They include a complete
set of membership functions and the most used defuzzification
method. The inference is quite simple and several functions could be
improved. There is an example of use based on the tipping problem.

This repository is a very preliminary version of a Clojure library and
it is intended to try the language on a real application. Clojure has
several advantages over other lisp-like languages such as execution on
the JVM and using Java libraries, and it is worth a try. Moreover, as
functional programming as recursion have always been terribly
fun. Please feel free to use or adapt as needed.
